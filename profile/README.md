# The Operating System for an Ideal World

Imagine the world was an open-source operating system like Unix. 

Turning real world organizations into crowdsourced apps has worked fairly well:

For example:
- taxies < Uber
- hotels < Airbnb

Imagine all our institutions could be apps.  

Imagine an FDA app that sucked in all the data on foods and drugs and health outcomes and could tell you precisely how every food and drug would affect you. 

Imagine an SEC app that allowed anyone to report fraudulent securities activity or crypto scams,  immediately alerted investors, and helped them file class action lawsuites to recover losses. 

Imagine that anyone with a new idea for improving it or solving a problem could simply:
1. fork the world
2. make their changes
3. submit a pull request to the main world repository
4. better world!

The Forkable World project is designed to help our institutions promote the general welfare through the principles of open-source software development and artificial intelligence. It contains applications and AI agents that support non-profit organizations and governments in their missions to create public goods and improve societal outcomes.

### Goals

The overarching goal of the Forkable World project is to demonstrate that governance, like software, can benefit from open-source principles, data-driven decision-making, and the innovative use of technology to serve public interests more effectively. It aims to foster a more participatory, transparent, and responsive model of governance that can adapt to the needs and challenges of modern societies.
